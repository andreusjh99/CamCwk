#                                             http://github.com/libatoms/QUIP
# whose installation is more complicated (needs a Fortran compiler, e.g. gfortran, and the use of the
# "make" command, for more details see the README in QUIP)

# calc = quippy.Potential('IP Morse', param_filename='ip.parms.Morse.Cu_PhysicsLetters_v23_p309_y1966.xml')
# calc.set_calc_args({'local_energy': True})
#
# if using this model, the unit cell needs to be extended by 10 Ang (without scaling the atoms!) in the Y and X directions,
# because quippy potentials always assume that the system is periodic in all three directions. By moving away the periodic
# images beyond the range of atomic interactions, a nonperiodic system is modelled.
