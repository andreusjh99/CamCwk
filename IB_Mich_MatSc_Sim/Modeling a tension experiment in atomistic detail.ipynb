    "In this exercise you will develop a simple, _atomic scale_ model of how metals respond under tensile stress. Simulating the response in such detail will allow you an insight into how dislocations are actually generated and interact, which is the basis for the plastic response of the material. Large scale plasticity is of course more complicated, and depends on the interactions of an immense number of dislocations as well as grain boundaries and more rigid inclusions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the course of the exercise, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create and manipulate atomic scale structural models of crystalline matter\n",
    "1. Compute simple elastic properties of single crystal copper (Cu)\n",
    "1. Set up and run a strain controlled tensile test simulation of a notched bar\n",
    "1. Examine newly created dislocations on the atomic scale\n",
    "\n",
    "This activity introduces you to _scientific computing_, the use of programming and numerical techniques to model, investigate and learn about a technical subject, in this case materials engineering. There is no extended programming required, and no significant software engineering skills introduced, beyond close reading of documentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Software Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be using a python package called [Atomic Simulation Environment](https://gitlab.com/ase/ase) (ASE), which you will need to download. It has excellent tutorials at its [documentation page](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/), but the first few exercises below will teach you many of the elements of ASE you will need for this project. Also try to install the ```matscipy``` package (which needs a working C++ compiler), if that is successful your simulations will be much faster. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended that you obtain a Python environment on your own computer such as [Anaconda](http://anaconda.org). However, much of this exercise can be completed using a cloud-based notebook server, such as Azure, in which case you can try installing the needed packages by using ```!pip install ase```, etc. directly in your notebook. Not all cloud-based servers will let you install packages, and the second part of the exercise is much easier done on your own computer. But Azure for example lets you open text terminal (console) to the virtual machine it is running on, so you can execute all the ! commands directly on the console. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ```!pip install ase``` and ```!pip install matscipy``` commands also work in an ```anaconda``` Python console or a Jupyter notebook that is running on your own computer, or without the \"!\" in a normal command terminal. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: There are several files associated with this notebook, both images and python code (e.g. Morse.py), make sure they are in the same folder as this notebook._\n",
    "\n",
    "_There is also a Morse module inside ASE (under ```ase.calculators```), but that is not implemented correctly, so make sure below that you import the one that is supplied here and saved in the current directory._\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Notes for various operating systems\n",
    "\n",
    "* On Mac OS, it is recommended that you do not work with the Python supplied by Apple, but get your own, e.g. Anaconda, or use Homebrew. \n",
    "\n",
    "* On Windows, you will need MS Visual C++ in order to use the matscipy package (MSVC++ version 14 for use with Python versions > 3.5). Windows is difficult from the point of view of scientific computing, and you may not be able to install matscipy in the end. The lab can be done without it. \n",
    "\n",
    "* If you are working on the Linux workstations in the Department,  see [this page](http://www-h.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/languages/python/pythonatcued.html) on how to install new Python packages for yourself. Note that the Ovito visualisation software (see Milestone 2 below) is not yet installed on the DPO workstations by default.  \n",

In particular:\n",

This is typically true for static properties that do not depend on atoms experiencing a variety of neighbour environments, i.e. in the absence of _defects_. Such properties include the _lattice constant_ (i.e. the density), the _equation of state_, the _elastic constants_ (including the _bulk modulus_), the _Poisson ratio_, etc. \n",
